    "Twinkle, twinkle, little star! How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. When the glorious sun is set, When the grass with dew is wet, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle all the night. In the dark-blue sky you keep, And often through my curtains peep, For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky. As your bright and tiny spark, Guides the traveller in the dark. Though I know not what you are, Twinkle, twinkle, little star!",

    "Whatever brawls disturb the street, There should be peace at home; Where sisters dwell and brothers meet, Quarrels should never come. Birds in their little nests agree; And 'tis a shameful sight, When children of one family Fall out, and chide, and fight.",
    "Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. One for my master, one for my dame, And one for the little boy that lives in our lane. Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.",
